# McView3D - Minecraft Skin Viewer API

## Introduction ðŸ“Œ
**McView3D** is an API that allows you to view Minecraft skins in 3D directly from your browser.  
It uses [SkinView3D](https://github.com/bs-community/skinview3d) as a base and adapts it into a simple and accessible interface through URL queries.

## Features ðŸ‘¾
- **3D view of Minecraft skins**

- **Load skins and capes via URL**

## Live Demo
Try the API directly in your browser:  
[McView3D](https://mc-view3-d.vercel.app/?skin=unlikekinght&height=400&width=400&cape=2016.png)

## Usages & parameters ðŸ“Œ
In this URL, the `skin` parameter at the end specifies the name of the skin you want to view.

To view a different skin, simply change the value of the `skin` parameter in the URL. Example:

- To view the **steve** skin:
  [Steve](https://mc-view3-d.vercel.app/?skin=steve)

You can customize the canvas size and add capes using the following parameters:

- `skin`: Specifies the Minecraft skin to display. If not provided, the default skin is `kuromy888`.
- `height`: Specifies the height of the canvas. Default is `400`.
- `width`: Specifies the width of the canvas. Default is `400`.
- `cape`: Specifies the name of the cape to display. If the value is set to `default`, the system will fetch the player's **Minecraft official cape** (the one configured in the official Minecraft launcher). If no cape is provided or if the cape name is not found, no cape will be displayed.
    - You can visit the `src/main/resources/static/src/capes` folder to see available custom capes, or provide a specific URL for a custom cape.

#### Example:
To view the **steve** skin with a canvas size of `300x300` and the `2016.png` cape:
[Steve with Cape](https://mc-view3-d.vercel.app/?skin=steve&height=300&width=300&cape=2016.png)

To view a player's skin (e.g., `kuromy888`) and automatically fetch their **official Minecraft cape**:
